Some details,
       especially technical, may have changed.</blockquote><div itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"><h1 itemprop="name">Tinsmith: Online Scala REPL/Worksheet</h1><div class="post" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I recently released a basic self-hosted, we based Scala REPL called <a href="https://github.com/kouphax/tinsmith">Tinsmith</a> (alternatively play with the <a href="http://tinsmith.herokuapp.com">online demo</a>). If you've been following Scala news recently you may have noticed a similar project <a href="http://codebrew.io">codebrew.io</a> being talked about and in fact <a href="https://github.com/kouphax/tinsmith">Tinsmith</a> is heavily built off the same stack.</p><p>So why bother doing yet another REPL/Worksheet when one already exists? Well the first spike came into existence because <a href="http://codebrew.io">codebrew.io</a> was rather sluggish one day I was using it and I wanted something I could run locally or deploy to a dedicated remote instance when I needed. Then as I had my own instance running there were things I realised I wanted to do differently or didn't need at all and so rather than cloning codebrew I decided to use some common techs to produce a slightly different experience.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tinsmith <strong>doesn't</strong> execute code automatically instead you need to explicitly execute code by <code>Alt-Enter</code> or <code>âŒ˜-Enter</code>.</li>
  <li>Tinsmith <strong>doesn't</strong> have the bells and whistles such as Doc lookup and autocomplete</li>
  <li>Tinsmith <strong>doesn't</strong> have Github integration (though it did have gist integration at one point but I decided against it)</li>
  <li>Tinsmith <strong>does</strong> save the code to the querystring to make pages bookmarkable (like <a href="http://jsconsole.com">jsconsole</a>)</li>
  <li>Tinsmith <strong>does</strong> return the console output as well as the REPL output</li>
  <li>Tinsmith <strong>does</strong> explicitly include some useful libs (Scala Utils, Scalaz, Guava etc.)</li>
  <li>Tinsmith <strong>does</strong> run as a single application and can be quickly deployed to Heroku</li>
  <li>Tinsmith <strong>does</strong> use WebSockets instead of Ajax</li>
</ul><p>This is in no way meant to act as competition to the clearly better <a href="http://codebrew.io">codebrew.io</a> - it's simply something I needed quickly and decided other people might benefit from it as well. Afterall it's just the <a href="https://github.com/jedesah/scala-codesheet-api">scala-codesheet</a> and <a href="http://codemirror.net/index.html">codemirror</a> thrown together with a bit of webby glue.</p></div><a class="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyobriefca.se%2Fblog%2F2013%2F11%2F17%2Ftinsmith-online-scala-repl-slash-worksheet%2F&amp;text=Tinsmith%3A%20Online%20Scala%20REPL%2FWorksheet&amp;via=kouphax" itemprop="discussionUrl" target="_blank">Tweet This</a><div class="dater"><time datetime="17-11-2013" itemprop="datePublished">November 17, 2013</time></div><div class="categories">Published in <a href="/categories/scala/">Scala</a> on November 17, 2013</div></div></div><div class="homer"><a href="/"><i class="icon-briefcase" style="font-size:32px;"></i></a></div></body></html>
