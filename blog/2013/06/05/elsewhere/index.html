It doesn't involve any code or analogies to writing software (that I'm aware of) so yeah.....</p><p>Many many years ago (well about 9 or 10) I went through a period of "being a singer/song-writer". There was no intention of making money or even playing live - I can barely speak to people I <strong>don't</strong> know let alone "perform" in front of them (though I can waffle about technical stuff Ad nauseam - oh the irony) - I just felt compelled to record some noise.</p><h2>Experiment #1</h2><p>The first time I did it was for my sister, a born and bred muso, as a birthday present - she had moved to London a few years ago and I wrote a song about her being always "busy".</p><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F95763666"></iframe></p><p>The quality is clearly terrible, the song is clearly terrible, I am clearly terrible.
