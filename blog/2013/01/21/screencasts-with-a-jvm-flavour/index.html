There is a launch post about it on the <a href="http://yobriefcasts.tv">site</a> as well as the first in a series of screencasts around Play! 2 (more being edited as you read this no doubt). Initially I never set out to focus on the world of the JVM but after building a list of potential topics and doing some research there is just so much there and so little audio/visual coverage of it that I think it deserves some attention.</p><p>As it stands right now there is an [optional] price associated with the productions - you can stream everything to your hearts content or you can pay a minimal sum to get a high quality download of the screencast - you can do both if you want. It took a while to come to an acceptable price point and structure because I have an end goal here - I want to feed any money earned back into the project to get better equipment and thusly produce better quality screencasts. Futhermore I'd eventually like to turn this into a (mostly) full time gig and move to a subscription model with frequent (weekly) releases - but thats a long way away yet - for now I want to see if I can build something people want and enjoy.</p><p>But hopefully the site can speak for itself - I've already got an extensive list of releases coming up over the next while so stay tuned, follow us on <a href="http://twitter.com/yobriefcasts">twitter as @yobriefcasts</a> and enjoy the <a href="http://yobriefcasts.tv">site</a>.</p></div><a class="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyobriefca.se%2Fblog%2F2013%2F01%2F21%2Fscreencasts-with-a-jvm-flavour%2F&amp;text=Screencasts%20with%20a%20JVM%20flavour&amp;via=kouphax" itemprop="discussionUrl" target="_blank">Tweet This</a><div class="dater"><time datetime="21-01-2013" itemprop="datePublished">January 21, 2013</time></div><div class="categories">Published in <a href="/categories/craftsmanship/">Craftsmanship</a> on January 21, 2013</div></div></div><div class="homer"><a href="/"><i class="icon-briefcase" style="font-size:32px;"></i></a></div><script type="text/javascript">(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
