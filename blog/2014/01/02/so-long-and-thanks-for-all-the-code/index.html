At the tail end of 2013 I decided to hand in and work out my notice with <a href="http://kainos.com">Kainos</a>. So from February onwards I'll be doing a spot of contracting, validating a few business ideas and generally seeing how I can benefit the tech community in and around Belfast as a free agent.</p><p>Recently the cost of being a full time employee in a company that is growing rapidly has outweighed the value I've drawn from it and committing to another year wouldn't have been the right decision for me. So, instead, I'll be giving up the warm comforting embrace of full time employment with a company that has given me plenty of support through the years to rough it in the wilds of the tech industry. Hopefully this move will offer me greater flexibility and control in what I do.</p><p>As of now it seems I'm going to be pretty busy for the first part of the year but if there is anything commercial or even community related you feel I could help with (this site should tell you <a href="/background">everything you need to know</a>) don't hesitate to <a href="mailto://james@yobriefca.se">contact me</a>.</p></div><a class="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyobriefca.se%2Fblog%2F2014%2F01%2F02%2Fso-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-code%2F&amp;text=So%20Long%2C%20and%20Thanks%20for%20All%20the%20Code&amp;via=kouphax" itemprop="discussionUrl" target="_blank">Tweet This</a><div class="dater"><time datetime="02-01-2014" itemprop="datePublished">January 02, 2014</time></div><div class="categories">Published in <a href="/categories/random/">Random</a> on January 02, 2014</div></div></div><div class="homer"><a href="/"><i class="icon-briefcase" style="font-size:32px;"></i></a></div></body></html>
