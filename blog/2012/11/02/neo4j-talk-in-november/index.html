Being busy for me usually implies I'm not getting bored on cookie cutter, by the numbers web apps, being busy means I'm doing new interesting stuff. I've been doing a bit of work with the UK Government, specifically DFID (Department for International Developement) around the nobel goal of transaprency and open data. The project involves interrogating a lot of highly connected data in weird and wonderful ways which can mean only one thing - Graph Databases. We tried the relational database route early on and it was causing too much pain to get the data we wanted,</p>

</div><p>So having recently been enlightened by <a href="https://twitter.com/jimwebber">Jim Webbers</a> talk on <a href="http://neo4j.org/">Neo4J</a> I decided to try the Graph Database appraoch and it paid off, in spades. Then one humble brag on Twitter later and I get asked to present a case study on Neo4J at the London User Group - and I'm stoked. This is the first talk I've ever given that I don't have to pretend to know what I'm talking about - awesome.</p><p>If you're in London on the 28th of November come along and see how I've (probably incorrectly) used Neo4J.</p>
