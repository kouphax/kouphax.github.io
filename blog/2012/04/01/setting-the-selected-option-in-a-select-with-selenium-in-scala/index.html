Anyway I've been doing a bit of work with bare-metal Selenium stuff in Scala recently and one of the things that kept me stumped for a while was setting the selected <code>option</code> for a particular <code>select</code> element.</p><p>I looked around the interwebs and didn't really find anything - now I'm not saying it isn't out there, I am certain it is, but I couldn't find it. So I decided to document how I did it in case any lone sole is stuck in a similar situation...</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="scala">  <span class="n">driver</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">findElement</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">By</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"year"</span><span class="o">)).</span>
    <span class="n">findElements</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">By</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tagName</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"option"</span><span class="o">)).</span>
    <span class="n">get</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">).</span>
    <span class="n">setSelected</span><span class="o">()</span>
</code></pre><p>So here I am simply finding the second <code>option</code> of the "year" <code>select</code> element and setting it selected. I know it looks obvious now but trust me I was scratching my head for an age on this one.</p><p>I hope it helps some one, eventually :)</p></div><a class="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyobriefca.se%2Fblog%2F2012%2F04%2F01%2Fsetting-the-selected-option-in-a-select-with-selenium-in-scala%2F&amp;text=Setting%20the%20Selected%20Option%20in%20a%20Select%20with%20Selenium%20in%20Scala&amp;via=kouphax" itemprop="discussionUrl" target="_blank">Tweet This</a><div class="dater"><time datetime="01-04-2012" itemprop="datePublished">April 01, 2012</time></div><div class="categories">Published in <a href="/categories/scala/">Scala</a> <a href="/categories/testing/">Testing</a> on April 01, 2012</div></div></div><div class="homer"><a href="/"><i class="icon-briefcase" style="font-size:32px;"></i></a></div></body></html>
