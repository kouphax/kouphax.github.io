Some details,

It's fulfils a need I keep having but never really fixing. </p><h2>Evelvator Pitch</h2><p>SYL, or lad for short, will take a git repo, clone it and replace a bunch of tokens in it with the values you've supplied. </p><h2>Say Wha?</h2><p>This means you can create a bunch of base solution/project types for any language and SYL will simply do some basic file/folder renaming and file content replacing for a given token. For example doing the following,</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code>lad /path/to/git/repo MyNewProject
</code></pre><p>Will do the following things,</p>
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repo at <code>path/to/git/repo</code> into a temporary folder</li>
  <li>Remove the <code>.git</code> folder from the repo</li>
  <li>Check for the existence of a <code>.ladconfig</code> in the freshly cloned repo</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>If one exists it loads the config setting</li>
  <li>Otherwise it falls back to the defaults</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li>Replace all instances of the configured token (eg. <code>__NAME__</code>) in all files, directories and file contents with the project name (in our case <code>MyNewProject</code>)</li>
  <li>Copy the new folder over to your current working directory (<code>./MyNewProject</code>)</li>
</ol><p>What this allows you to do is have a standard project template for pretty much anything (.NET, Ruby, Scala - listen I mean anything - if it a collection of folders and files in a git repo then you set) and create a new instance with a few keystrokes - saving you time and potential RSI.</p><p>SYL was inspired by <a href="https://github.com/chucknorris/warmup">WarmuP</a> which is itself a gem but it requires you to be running .NET which for a lot of my requirement isn't going to cut it.</p><p>If you want to see what a typical template project looks like try <a href="https://github.com/amirrajan/Loam">Amir's Loam repo</a>. This is a WarmuP project but works just fine. With SYL you can create a <code>.ladconfig</code> file to override some of the conventions - get the source README linked above.</p><h2>Whats Next</h2><p>Yep it's pretty damn basic right now but it satifies most of my needs right now. There are a few things I want to add for myself but I didn't release this for ME, I am pretty sure this will be of use to someone in some community in some shape or form. With that in mind here are some features I think would take this to the next level,</p>
<ol>
  <li>Specifiying multiple tokens e.g. <code>__NAME__</code> and <code>__NAMESPACE__</code> and <code>__YEAR__</code> etc. etc.</li>
  <li>Post processing actions (e.g. <code>bundle install</code> or <code>npm install</code> or <code>sbt compile</code> or something like that)</li>
  <li>A catalog - I have a <a href="https://github.com/strapping-young-lad">github organisation</a> with no repos setup right now but this would be a brilliant place to hold a load of templates compatible with SYL, don't ya think? Then I could roll a site like rubygems or npmjs.org and make the projects searchable etc. If you build it, they will come. Maybe, who knows.</li>
</ol><p>So if you like it - HIGHFIVE - if not - it's all good. Now go break it and criticise me. </p>
