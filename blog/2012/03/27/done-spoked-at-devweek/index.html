Not having been sick for most of the winter my body decided a day before DevWeek to go into shut down. I spent Tuesday in bed with very little voice. Thankfully the head colds hold on my vocal chords relented this morning and I think I managed to project as best I could. </p><p>So initial thoughts of how it went? I honestly think I'm getting better at this presenting thing so that must be a good thing, unless I was TERRIBLE before. The 2 main annoyances that have been raised thus far have been</p><h2>1. Too Short</h2><p>I did my usual "talk really fast and finish earlier than planned" thing I sometimes do. But there was plenty of discussion afterwards which I tought was interesting. FWIW when I present this to myself it takes longer. My internal monologue must be slower than the way I speak. Apologies to anyone that felt it was "too short".</p><h2>2. Not enough Visual Studio</h2><p>I opted to play it safe end embed code into my slides rather than code live - I didn't go unnoticed and I had a few comments that "moar codez" would have been good. Totally agree. </p><h2>Other Stuff</h2><p>I opted to change my slide deck between submitting them for print and presenting. I did it out of desire to devlier a better, more structured, talk (my first set being quite short as I was going for a "free-form" type of presentation). Probably not the most professional approach to do this but at least I can say my heart was in the right place :) Here are offending articles BTW</p>

Thanks to all who attended and any other feedback you have throw it my way so I can get better at this talking malarky.</p><p>Also thanks to the folks at DevWeek for the opportunity - hopefully you'll have me back at some point.</p></div><a class="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyobriefca.se%2Fblog%2F2012%2F03%2F27%2Fdone-spoked-at-devweek%2F&amp;text=Done%20Spoked%20at%20DevWeek&amp;via=kouphax" itemprop="discussionUrl" target="_blank">Tweet This</a><div class="dater"><time datetime="27-03-2012" itemprop="datePublished">March 27, 2012</time></div><div class="categories">Published in <a href="/categories/random/">Random</a> on March 27, 2012</div></div></div><div class="homer"><a href="/"><i class="icon-briefcase" style="font-size:32px;"></i></a></div></body></html>
