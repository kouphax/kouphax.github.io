It was so good I did it twice in the same day. How'd it go? Went good I guess. From a conference stand point it seemed to fly by. There was a kind of laid back atmosphere about the whole thing and the numbers, while lower than expected were high enough to make all the talks feel comfortably occupied. I skipped the first block to get my talk prepared but managed to pull in a few talks after I got my first one over.</p><h1>Other Peoples Talks</h1><h2>Behavioural Driven Development (BDD) with F# - Phillip Trelford</h2><p>Big toss up here as I wanted to attend <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/dddie11/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=871">Andrea's Code Kata</a> as well but this talk won out. It was a decent talk - a nice mix of theory and practise. Interesting to see Phils testing framework, <a href="http://tickspec.codeplex.com">TickSpec</a>, in action, I must revisit this again some time soon (a promise I'll probably never keep :( ).</p><h2>CQRS - Bringing Elegance to "Normal" Applications - Ashic Mahtab</h2><p>The last CQRS talk I attended flew right over my head in terms of complexity. Since then I've done a bit of research and came prepared. I really didn't need to though. Ashic did a really good job of taking something that appears quite complex and conveying the message quite nicely. Interested to see his 250 LOC CQRS framework as well!</p><h1>My Talks</h1><h2>refORM: Death to ORMs in .NET</h2><p>Went quite well. I played it safe in terms of not going for any live coding but I think it would have been much better if I had (and plan to next time week at DDDNorth) as it was more dry than I would have liked. Lots of good discussion after the presentation that I might try and bring in next time too.</p><h2>Coffeescript the Awesome</h2><p>Slight technical problem resulted in the majority of the code samples being nearly unreadable for a lot of the presentation which was a total fail. I think I flew through the whole thing too - perhaps a bit of live coding would have improved this one too. That said the discussion lasted as long as the talk more or less which is good. Another problem was a number of people came in quite late and missed the first lot of slides which meant I was repeating the content at the end but hey thats fine.</p></div><a class="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyobriefca.se%2Fblog%2F2011%2F10%2F02%2Fdddbelfast-retrospective%2F&amp;text=DDDBelfast%20Retrospective&amp;via=kouphax" itemprop="discussionUrl" target="_blank">Tweet This</a><div class="dater"><time datetime="02-10-2011" itemprop="datePublished">October 02, 2011</time></div><div class="categories">Published in <a href="/categories/dot-net/">.NET</a> on October 02, 2011</div></div></div><div class="homer"><a href="/"><i class="icon-briefcase" style="font-size:32px;"></i></a></div></body></html>
