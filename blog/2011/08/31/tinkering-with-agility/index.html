<ol>
  <li>It's a bit buggy in places (it is currently on v0.1 so this is to be expected)</li>
  <li>At first glance code written against <a href="http://agilityjs.com/">agility.js</a> looks like a total mess though it appears to be a weird optical illusion because once you grasp the <a href="http://agilityjs.com/">agility.js</a> approach the code makes total sense</li>
  <li><a href="http://agilityjs.com/">Agility</a> would fit well into an existing codebase as much as into a new one. Certainly more so that some of the other frameworks. And finally,</li>
  <li>I like it</li>
</ol><p>You could almost class <a href="http://agilityjs.com/">agility.js</a> as a micro MVC framework (and we all know how I like them). I say that because it takes an incredibly simple approach to MVC as well as offering a very small but (IMHO) complete feature set. Unlike <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">knockout</a>, which also makes use of the <code>data-</code> attributes for model binding (and more), <a href="http://agilityjs.com/">agility.js</a> uses the <code>data-bind</code> attribute for model binding and thats it. </p><p>With Agility you have that ability to compose UI's from discrete little self-contained, and/or nested agility objects that behave as standalone MVC implementations. This is <em>kind of</em> different to the standard appraoch of other MVC-like JS frameworks which generally go for the create a single large MVC architecture and manage components within that architecture. I am not saying this appraoch is forbidden or impossible in the other frameworks - it's just not how a noob would go about things. At least I never did when I first started looking at them.</p><p>To play with agility I went ahead and created "yet another Todo app" (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/kouphax/agility-tinkering">source</a>) complete with server side persistence and some responsive UI elements (Complete button will vanish when a Todo is completed - wow). I'll not break the entire thing down here but here are some choice cuts (in CoffeeScript cause I am THAT cool)</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code>todo = $$ 
  model: {}, 
  view:
    format: '''
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;span data-bind="description"/&gt;
        &lt;button class="complete-task"&gt;Complete&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;button class="delete-task"&gt;Delete&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    ''',
  controller: 
    'create': -&gt; 
      @view.$().toggleClass "task-done", @model.get("complete")
    'change:complete': -&gt; 
      @view.$().addClass "task-done"
    'click .complete-task': -&gt;  
      @model.set "complete": true
      @persist $$.adapter.restful, collection:'todos'
      @save()
    'click .delete-task': -&gt;  
      @persist $$.adapter.restful, collection:'todos'
      @erase()
</code></pre><p>The code above shows the creation of a Todo entity i.e. a single entry in the list. <code>$$</code> is the Agility factory method and will create an MVC based entity out of the object passed in. I have decalred a view, a model (albeit empty) and a controller with an assortment of tasks for the entity.</p><p>This will give you two-way model binding, event wiring up and even custom events totally for free plus a very simple way to react to events. The controller is essentially the event handler so things like <code>click .delete-task</code> will bind the handler to the click event of the element with the <code>delete-task</code> class (the typical full range of selectors are available thanks to jQuery, Zepto integration forthcoming too). Events like <code>create</code> and <code>change:complete</code> are custom events given to us by agility and allow us to listen to key points in the lifecycle of the object. In fact <code>change:complete</code> is a demonstration of something truly awesome (IMHO as usual). The <code>change</code> event will fire when model properties are changed - the <code>change:&lt;property_name&gt;</code> will only fire when the <code>complete</code> property changes. Noice!</p><p>My Todo list object then creates instances of the <code>todo</code> object above after pulling the info from the server. It uses agility's inheritance strategy to to create them from the <code>todo</code> prototype I pass in</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code>todos = $$
  model: {},
  view: 
    format: '''
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" id="newItem" /&gt;
        &lt;button class="add-task"&gt;Add&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;ol/&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    '''
  controller:
    'click .add-task': -&gt; 
      item = @view.$('#newItem').val()
      if item isnt ""            
        newTodo = $$ todo, description: item
        newTodo.persist $$.adapter.restful, collection:'todos'
        newTodo.save()
        @empty()
        @gather todo, 'append', 'ol'
</code></pre><p>Next I append the <code>todos</code> object to the document (which renders it and wires things up)</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code>$$.document.append todos
</code></pre><p>Persistance is provided as a plugin of sorts with ability to provide your own adapters. You get a RESTful ajax adapter with Agility. I use this to provide persistence methods on my objects and let agility set that up.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code>todo.persist $$.adapter.restful, collection:'todos'
todos.persist()
</code></pre><p>There does seem to be a bug with the factory method and persitance enabled object forcing me to call <code>persist</code> prior to any sort of persitence operation but hopefully we will see that resolved soon.</p><p>Finally I fetch from the server and wipe the awesome sauce from my lips and beard.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code>todos.gather todo, 'append', 'ol'
</code></pre><p>I've went on more than I wanted to but hey it's worth it. Hopefully this has helped clarify agility to a few people or at least got people intrigued.
