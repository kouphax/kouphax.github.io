After 4 pomodoros you take a longer break (15-30 minutes).  The rules are as follows,</p><ul><li>A Pomodoro Consists of 25 minutes Plus a Five-Minute Break.</li><li>After Every Four Pomodoros Comes a 15-30 Minute Break. </li><li>The Pomodoro Is Indivisible. There are no half or quarter Pomodoros. </li><li>If a Pomodoro Begins, It Has to Ring:   <ul><li>If a Pomodoro is interrupted definitively – i.e. the interruption isn't handled it's considered void, never begun, and it can't be recorded with an X. </li><li>If an activity is completed once a Pomodoro has already begun, continue reviewing the same activity until the Pomodoro rings. </li></ul></li><li>Protect the Pomodoro. Inform effectively, negotiate quickly to reschedule the interruption, call back the person who interrupted you as agreed. </li><li>If It Lasts More Than 5-7 Pomodoros, Break It Down. Complex </li><li>activities should be divided into several activities. </li><li>If It Lasts Less Than One Pomodoro, Add It Up. Simple tasks can be combined. </li></ul><h2>My Honest Opinion</h2><p>My previous development strategy was all kinds of broken.  It worked provided I wasn't disturbed and I didn't really have a point at which I could turn round to someone and say </p><p><span style=""> <span style=""> </span></span>“give me 5 minutes and I'll get back to you”</p><p>The pom gives me that excuse and with the use of a simple widget I am able to know when I'll next be free (and so are other people).  The hardest thing for me to accept was actually taking the 5 minute break post-pom. Initially (and sometimes still) I'd just work over the 5 minutes — just one more line of code, just test it once more — excuses, excuses, excuses.  Breaking old habits is hard!  Some of the other benefits from the technique is that, </p><ul><li>it really helps you visualise your task up front and break it down much better</li><li>it helps you track work that you have done and how long tasks take.  </li><li>some pomodoro software even integrates into popular task lists and calendars</li></ul><h2>Resources</h2><p>The Pomodoro Technique website is by far the best resource for this stuff and even has a free ebook on the technique and its background</p><ul><li>The site: <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/"></a><a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/</a></li><li>The book: <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/products.html#pomodoropdf"></a><a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/products.html#pomodoropdf">http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/products.html#pomodoropdf</a></li></ul><p>Personally it's going to take me while longer to get into the right mentality 100% but I think the benefits will be worth it.  One day I'll be so efficient the code will just stream out of my brain and into my IDE - but for now I'll stick the mortals way of doing things.</p></div><a class="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyobriefca.se%2Fblog%2F2011%2F04%2F05%2Ftechnically-non-technical-the-pomodoro-technique%2F&amp;text=Technically%20Non-Technical%3A%20The%20Pomodoro%20Technique&amp;via=kouphax" itemprop="discussionUrl" target="_blank">Tweet This</a><div class="dater"><time datetime="05-04-2011" itemprop="datePublished">April 05, 2011</time></div><div class="categories">Published in <a href="/categories/craftsmanship/">Craftsmanship</a> on April 05, 2011</div></div></div><div class="homer"><a href="/"><i class="icon-briefcase" style="font-size:32px;"></i></a></div></body></html>
