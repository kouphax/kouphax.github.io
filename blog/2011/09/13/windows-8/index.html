More so in fact Windows 8 appears to be effectivley deprecating the desktop idea over time. It's a bold move but trying to cater to every platform is surely a recipe for disaster but you know what I can't help but like it. </p><p>I'm not convinced by the Vista v2 arguments either but then I do most of my "poweruser" stuff via a command prompt and thats not going to change - when I hit the desktop I am looking for a nice experience and I feel, so far, I get that with Windows 8.</p><p>Being an idiot I managed to grab the ISO without VS11/Blend 5 on it so I am waiting for that one to download before sharing opinions on them (Blend 5 surely must be just like Dreamweaver but I stand to be proven wrong). I am told, however, the first options on the New Project dialog in VS11 are JavaScript projects - I like that. :-)</p></div><a class="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyobriefca.se%2Fblog%2F2011%2F09%2F13%2Fwindows-8%2F&amp;text=Windows%208&amp;via=kouphax" itemprop="discussionUrl" target="_blank">Tweet This</a><div class="dater"><time datetime="13-09-2011" itemprop="datePublished">September 13, 2011</time></div><div class="categories">Published in <a href="/categories/dot-net/">.NET</a> on September 13, 2011</div></div></div><div class="homer"><a href="/"><i class="icon-briefcase" style="font-size:32px;"></i></a></div></body></html>
