</blockquote><p>Activity on this site has declined recently. Initially it was intentional (in 2014 I decided to reduce my speaking engagements and focus on contracting), take a break, clear the head etc. but I got sidetracked and kept meaning to get back to a bit of writing and speaking. This proved harder than usual. Travelling every week kind of knocks the wind out of you, or me at least.</p><p>In an effort to shine a light on the lack of activity I created a <a href="http://yobriefca.se/metrics">contribution chart</a> to show the drop off and, interestingly enough, I've been in a bit of a dip since before I actively decided to take a break. Or perhaps I'm just finding my rhythm. Or perhaps consistency isn't my strong point, you know like MongoDB.</p><p>Anyway the plan is to get back at it, talk more, write more and rant more. I've missed it.</p><p>For the interested the <a href="http://yobriefca.se/metrics">contribution chart</a> was thrown together using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a> a hacked version of the <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063318">calendar view example</a> and CSV data generated every time this site generates.</p></div><a class="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyobriefca.se%2Fblog%2F2015%2F04%2F29%2Fdont-call-it-a-comeback%2F&amp;text=Don%27t%20Call%20It%20A%20Comeback&amp;via=kouphax" itemprop="discussionUrl" target="_blank">Tweet This</a><div class="dater"><time datetime="29-04-2015" itemprop="datePublished">April 29, 2015</time></div><div class="categories">Published in <a href="/categories/random/">Random</a> on April 29, 2015</div></div></div><div class="homer"><a href="/"><i class="icon-briefcase" style="font-size:32px;"></i></a></div></body></html>
