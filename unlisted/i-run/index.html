Cycling is an activity I just don't enjoy and also I am historically accident prone while doing it while walking is an activity I love but is a massive time sink to do it properly.</p><p>I run because there are nice forest paths and countryside near where I live so I get to get outside.</p><p>I run because it's a great opportunity to really just think things through.</p><p>I run, more now than previous years, because I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617452-the-end-of-the-world-running-club">The End of the World Running Club</a> at the middle of last year and for some reason it stuck with me.</p><p>I don't run to get better times or longer distances. I don't run to compete in any meaningful way. Every time I intentionally try to improve (on a per run basis - I quite like seeing yearly distances improve) it seems to suck the fun out of it and I get demotivated. Right now I like to run for about an hour or so each time, occasionally I just keep running for up to 2 hours but I don't really force myself, if it feels right I keep going.</p><p>I find the hardest runs are the ones when I have nothing to think about or nothing compelling to listen to (podcasts or music wise). I find the easiest runs are the ones when I'm working on a problem and time just flies.</p><p>I rarely let myself feel out of breath or exhausted because when that happens I just keep moving but slow the pace. I just plod along at decent enough pace (for me), cover a distance I'm happy with and that's that.</p><p>Here's a wee heat map of the places I ran last year. Might be nice to diversify a tiny bit this year?</p><h2>South Belfast</h2><p><img src="/images/blog/runs/south-belfast-run.png" alt="South Belfast runs" _="_" /></p><h2>North Belfast</h2><p><img src="/images/blog/runs/north-belfast-run.png" alt="North Belfast runs" _="_" /></p><h2>London</h2><p><img src="/images/blog/runs/london-run.png" alt="London runs" _="_" /></p><p>And here is some meaningless stats for you to ignore,</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code>Distance:   1,015.5 km
Time:       104h 9m
Elev Gain:  9,422 m
Runs:       123
</code></pre><p>Thinking I could probably boost that distance figure if I maintain the same attitude I had since the middle of last year.</p></div><a class="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyobriefca.se%2Funlisted%2Fi-run%2F&amp;text=I%20Run&amp;via=kouphax" itemprop="discussionUrl" target="_blank">Tweet This</a><div class="dater"><time datetime="05-01-2017" itemprop="datePublished">January 05, 2017</time></div><div class="categories">Published in  on January 05, 2017</div></div></div><div class="homer"><a href="/"><i class="icon-briefcase" style="font-size:32px;"></i></a></div></body></html>
